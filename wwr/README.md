# 🌊 Adepegba Rafting Organisation Website

This project is a multi-page responsive website for a fictional rafting company: Adepegba Rafting Organisation. It was created as part of my web development learning journey (HTML & CSS) to practice building structured, styled, and professional websites.

## 📌 Features

- 🔹 HTML5 (Content & Structure)

  - Home Page: Landing page with hero image, welcome message, and quick trip links.

  - About Page: Company history, mission statement, and gallery of past rafting adventures.

  - Trips Page: Detailed descriptions of rafting trips (Amazon Jungle, Urubamba River, Multi-Sport Adventures, etc.) with images and booking buttons.

  - Contact Page: Includes company address, phone, email, Google Maps integration, enquiry form, and team section.

  - Navigation: Consistent header navigation across all pages and social media links in the footer.

- 🔹 CSS3 (Design & Styling)

  - Implemented a global CSS reset with box-sizing: border-box.

  - Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern responsive layouts.

  - Introduced CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent colors and fonts.

  - Styled hero sections, galleries, and trip details with borders, shadows, and hover effects.

  - Designed forms with fieldsets, inputs, checkboxes, and buttons for accessibility.

  - Added hover states for buttons and links for better user interactivity.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:

- Creating multi-page websites with consistent navigation and footers.

- Using semantic HTML5 tags (header, main, section, article, footer).

- Working with CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout management.

- Designing reusable components with CSS variables.

- Adding forms for user input and interaction.

- Integrating Google Maps via iframe.

- Creating a professional look with fonts (Google Fonts), hover effects, and spacing.

## 📖 My Learning Journey

This rafting website represents a step forward in my web development journey:

- I moved from simple one-page projects to multi-page designs.

- Learned to combine design, structure, and functionality in a real-world style project.

- Improved my CSS organization using variables, resets, and modular styling.

- Practiced building a website that feels like a real business landing page.

<p>My next steps are to enhance interactivity with JavaScript, improve responsiveness for mobile devices, and eventually connect the forms to a backend.</p>
