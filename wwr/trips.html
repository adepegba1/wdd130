                    <p>Adventurous travellers who live for active vacations will find a lot to love in a 
                        multi-sport trip. These types of itineraries typically combine several different 
                        types of activities into a single trip, breaking up the routine and finding new 
                        ways to challenge us. A multi-sport excursion could combine rafting, biking and 
                        sea kayaking for instance, or even throw mountain biking, hiking, and river rafting 
                        into the mix as well.
